# Gauss-Jordan_GF2
Forward and backward Gauss-Jordan elimination steps in GF(2) for **Python3** 🐍

## Two functions, infinite possibilities 🌈⧝🌌
Two main functions are defined:
- `FG_partial_pivoting` for performing forward elimination step of Gauss-Jordan elimination in GF(2), with partial pivoting (i.e. rows only). _Returns row echelon form matrix_
- `BG` for performing backward substitution part of Gauss-Jordan elimination in GF(2). _Returns reduced row echelon form matrix_

## Served with example 🥗
Fresh example from:
> A New (k, n)-Threshold Secret Sharing Scheme and Its Extension.
> By _Jun Kurihara_, _Shinsaku Kiyomoto_, _Kazuhide Fukushima_, and _Toshiaki Tanaka_
